# R to visualize your data  

## why visualize your data and why use R to do it (~ 10 min)?

Here we'll argue why use R for doing your plots:

  - visualizing data  
  - what makes a good graph (some details)  
  - work-flow (data are already in R)
  - base graph / ggplot2 / web graphs (interacting)
  - code / reproducible


# Common plots used in meta-analyses (~ 20 min)

## Briefly

Here we'll review the common plots found in meta-analyses as well as the R packages one can use to create them:

  - histogram effect size / number of studies   
  - Funnel with Trim and Fill:   http://www.metafor-project.org/doku.php/plots:funnel_plot_with_trim_and_fill   
  - regression effect side against and a relevant factor    
  - `metafor` package   
  - authors contribution to the field   


# Funnel plot from scratch (~ 20 min)

## Funnel plot from scratch

During this section we'll try to create our own funnel plot:

  - par
  - background
  - axes
  - points/lines
  - titles
  - legend
  - landmarks
  - export your plot

# Let's practice (~ 30 min)

## reproduce one figure

may be the figures from Vellend et al. 2014 in PNAS


# Let's have some fun (~ 15 min)

## WordCloud

Here, I'll try to provide further insights. To do so,
we'll show a couple of plots such as:

  - Wordcloud
  - Network of co-authors
